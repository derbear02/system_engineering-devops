#!/bin/bash
ls
```

**Explanation:**
- `#!/bin/bash` - The shebang line (tells the system to use Bash)
- `ls` - The command that **lists** the contents of the current directory

**5. Commit the file** with a message like: `Add 1-listit script`

---

## What this script does:

The `ls` command stands for "list" and it displays all the files and directories in your current working directory. When you run the script, it will show output similar to the example:
```
Applications    Documents   Dropbox Movies Pictures
Desktop Downloads   Library Music Public
```

The exact output will depend on what files and directories are in the location where you run the script.

**Your file structure should now look like:**
```
0x00-shell_basics/
├── README.md
├── 0-current_working_directory
└── 1-listit
